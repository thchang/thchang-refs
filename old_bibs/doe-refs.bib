% A Fortran 90 implementation of quasi-Newton stochastic optimization algorithms. This open source numerical software solves both determinisitc and stochastic blackbox optimization problems via a quasi-Newton trust-region method. It is a bit wasteful in terms of the number of function evaluations per iteration as it performs a fully Latin hypercube sampling of the trust region in each iteration, and does not explicitly re-use previous iterates to reduce iteration costs, like some of the more advanced model based methods. Still, it is extremely robust and a good choice in stochastic situations. Also includes a good Fortran implementation of Latin hypercube sampling and efficient sorting algorithms

% A numerical-quadrature based approximation to discrepancy. For high-dimensional ill-spaced points, the quadrature error can be huge, and although discrepancies should always be between 0 and 1, the approximation can approach (13/12)^d - 1, where d is the dimension of the problem. When points are randomly or quasi-randomly sampled, such large values of the approximation could be indicative of measure collapse. This is the technique used in scipy.stats.qmc.discrepancy(...)

% Official publication of the scipy.stats.qmc module, which is the newly released module for performing quasi-monte carlo sampling and design-of-experiments in scipy. Scipy is an open source numerical software package which is the standard for advanced numerical methods and scientific software packages in Python. Most of scipy are wrappers for much older Fortran or C++ code, that has been highly optimized.

% The SMT 2.0 paper, major improvements to the open source numerical software package (in Python) pySMT for solving multidisciplinary engineering design optimization (MDO) problems, while utilizing derivatives and providing numerical stability analysis for each surrogate model class. In SMT 2.0, support is added for hierarchical and mixed variables, and major improvements have been made to the structure, completeness, and features of the SMT library.
