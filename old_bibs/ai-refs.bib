% Interesting paper on why it is generally OK to use local optimizers when solving non convex optimization problems in high-dimensional spaces. In general, in high-dimensional spaces, almost every critical point will be a saddle point with high probability. Therefore, first-order methods tend to perform very well on these problems as they converge quickly but are not attracted to saddle points and therefore tend to find the global optimum in the limit. The analysis of the probability that a critical point will be a saddle point is based on a spectral analysis of the hessian at each critical point other than the global minimum/maximum -- all of the eigenvalues must be positive or negative for the critical point to be a local minima / maxima, and the probability of this occurring decays as the number of eigenvalues grows with the dimension of the Hessian. The authors also experimentally validate these claims by extracting critical points from the loss landscapes of single layer MLPs trained on down-sampled versions of MNIST and CIFAR-10.

% The original paper for AdaGrad (adaptive subgradient method) which replaced the subgradient method with an adaptive estimate for the gradient, where each component of the gradient is rescaled by an adaptive estimate for the standard deviation in that direction based on previous iterates. This adaptive estimate for standard deviation in each axis-aligned direction serves as a diagonal approximation to the Hessian matrix, giving second-order like properties to the method and greatly improving the practical convergence. AdaGrad was very popular and considered the state-of-the-art optimization algorithm for training neural networks upon its initial release, but was quickly replaced by Adam, which added a Nesterov momentum esque smoothing to this adaptive gradient estimation in order to further improve convergence rates on nonsmooth, highly stochastic, and ill-conditioned problems

% Original publication on Nesterov's momentum. I haven't read it (it is hard to find a copy and likely in Russian) but this is the preferred citation. The equation for Nesterov momentum in gradient descent is instead of using the update: x' = x - a*g(x), use x' = x - a*g(y) - b*v where y = x - b*v and v = b*v + a*g(x) -- in this equation, b*v is the momentum term which smooths out poor conditioning in the problem by encouraging the algorithm to continue in the direction it was headed instead of oscillating. Nexterov proves that this term also leads to better convergence rates. For best results, b is usually chosen to be a large value such as 0.9 or 0.99

% The culmination of a line of work from Google DeepMind on discovering better
% matrix factorization algorithms using reinforcement learning.  They defined a
% tensor game for trying to solve matrix multiplication at a fixed size in
% fewer moves, then trained a RL agent to play the game using monte carlo tree
% search and training a neural network to predict a manageable subset of states
% and expected state outcomes since the number of states was too numerous for
% true MCTS.  They were able to match the performance of Strassen's algorithm

% Introduces the idea of semantic regularization for generating word
% embeddings.  This is a massive improvement over bag of word embeddings, where
% each word gets a dimension and sentences / documents are embedded as vectors
% listing the number of occurrences for each word.  Instead, for this work,
% words are compressed into a continuous latent space using a RNN-based
% compression model.  In the compression, the embedding is regularized by
% relationships between words.  For example, 
% embedding(king):embedding(queen) ~ embedding(man):embedding(woman) and
% embedding(clothes):embedding(shirt) ~ embedding(dishes):embedding(bowl).
% These relationships are enforced using the cosin similarity score of their
% embeddings.  The authors also collected a massive dataset of english words
% and the corresponding relationships, and successfully trained the first word
% to vector embedding that (mostly) preserves these relationships, meaning that
% all vector operations remain meaningful

% DeepSeek-V3 technical report:  DeepSeek-V3 is the first open source model to

% experts model.  The first layer is an embedding layer that is shared by all
% models and trained on the data (as opposed to using word2vec).  Next, the
% architecture passes through alternating multi-headed latent attention and
% feed-forward (i.e., MLP) layers.  The latent attention blocks are shared
% between all experts.  Each expert then has its own multi-layer perceptron
% consisting of feed-forward layers with sigmoidal activation functions.
% Each individual expert model is run sequential and used to generate a
% sequence of multiple output tokens (as opposed to just the next word).  All
% experts are run in parallel.  The predictions from each expert are ultimately

% DeepSeek-R1 tech report:  DeepSeek-R1 is DeepSeek's first state-of-the-art
% reasoning model.  DeepSeek-R1-Zero was fine-tuned from DeepSeek-V3, by
% allowing chain-of-thought reasoning and using training objectives without
% cold start consisting of mostly checkable rules and formatting.  I.e., it is
% possible to penalize any computer code that doesn't compile, any images that
% spill out of a bounding box, and any thought chains that are not enclosed
% within <think></think> blocks.  This model has good performance but mixes
% languages and doesn't always generate human readable output.  Next, they
% trained DeepSeek-R1 using some carefully crafted cold-start examples to
% enforce reasoning and logic and output language consistency, using mostly
% coding, math, logic, and science problem sets and language mixing penalties.
% These penalties are critically applied inside as well as without the CoT
% blocks.  The authors trained both R1 and R1-Zero via reinforcement learning
% with group relative policy optimization (GRPO).  They claim the model
% naturally learned to use long chains of thoughts and internal discussions
% unprompted, but that's debatable since this kind of discussion is actually
% common in internet data.  The resulting model performs well on standard AI
% model benchmarks.  They also show that information from their large MoE
% models can be distilled into smaller dense models with better results than
% just fine-tuning those dense models on the same data
