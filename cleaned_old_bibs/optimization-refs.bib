While the algorithm is a simple heuristic that is extremely wasteful in terms of the number of true blackbox function / simulation evaluations, it performs extremely well in practice by the hypervolume indicator.

COBYLA basically performs gradient descent on a constrainted blackbox optimization problem by fitting a linear model to the underlying function and following its gradient within a shrinking trust region. COBYLA is typically able to do this taking typically only one or two function evaluation per iteration since typically only one point is exiting the trust-region per iteration. (Occasionally, additional model improvement points must be sampled to maintain the interpolation set geometry). This makes COBYLA barely more expensive then true gradient descent. COBYQA has supplanted COBYLA since then (the Q standing for quadratic), but I personally prefer COBYLA still as a find the locally linear models to be more robust against noisy and nonsmooth data, still efficiently finding local minima even though COBYLA was not design for such problems. The original open source software was in impossibly complex old-style Fortran. A modern Fortran version has been provided in Pima by Zaikun Zhang, and a modern Python implementation is provided in PDFO by Ragonneau and Zhang.},
